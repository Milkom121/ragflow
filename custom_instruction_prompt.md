# Custom Instruction Prompt for RagFlow Project

## Important Guidelines to Follow

- Always remember to update the `roadmap.md` file after completing each task.
- Follow strictly the instructions at the beginning of `roadmap.md`:
  - At the end of every task, it is mandatory to write and execute functional tests. The tests must pass successfully before proceeding to the next task.
  - After each task, update the `roadmap.md` document by writing a brief report under the corresponding phase of the work plan, describing the test results and any issues encountered.
  - Use colors and emojis in the text to make the reading as clear and engaging as possible.
- The goal is to maintain a clear and up-to-date trace of all work done, facilitating project management and communication with the client.

## Additional Contextual Instructions

- Always keep the project structure, milestones, and task details in mind when working.
- Ensure that all code changes are consistent with the roadmap and documented design files.
- Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices in all implementations.
- Communicate progress clearly and promptly, referencing the roadmap and documentation.
- When in doubt, refer back to the roadmap and design documents (`roadmap.md`, `ragflow-user-design.md`, etc.) for guidance.
